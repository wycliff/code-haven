# code-haven
CODE HAVEN is repository that contains a number of common algorithmic computer science solutions to problems implemented mostly in the JAVA programming language.

##DevidCounquer2
This shows an implementation for finding the minimum and the maximum of an array of integers using a recursive devide and conquer algorithmic approach.

## Insertion Sort: 
This shows an implementation of the insertion sort algorithm in JAVA.Here it is used to sort a number of integers in non- decreasing  order.
The implementation was done using  netbeans IDE. 

## Selection Sort: 
This shows an implementation of the selection sort algorithm in JAVA.Here it is used to sort a number of integers in non- decreasing  order.
The implementation was done using  netbeans IDE.
